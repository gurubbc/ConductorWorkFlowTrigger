This is a SpringBoot with one endpoint (/triggerWorkFlow) with GET method
So, if you send a request to this endpoint, it will trigger / start the workflow called "guru_sequential_http" which is already present in the orkes playground
https://play.orkes.io/workflowDef/guru_sequential_http

Download this, and update maven project
Right click the main program and run as spring boot

Access the endpoint
If everything goes fine, it will trigger the workflow, you will see the workflow id
